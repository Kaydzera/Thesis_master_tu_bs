good to know. We will fix this later. Here is a list of things i would like to change
1. The title does look a little funny. Can you pls increase the line distance there a bit?

2. We call the mathematical problem to generate the upper bounds "ceiling knapsack relaxation". Can you pls change that to "knapsack problem with a modified objective" in the thesis?

3. In the motivation, we used cloud computing as an example application. Can you pls instead use production scheduling? I think that fits better to the problem setting.

4. From the contributions onwards, we use the term "bilevel knapsack-scheduling problem". This is a short and good name for Bilevel Parallel Machine Scheduling, but we need to introduce it properly. Can you pls add a sentence in the introduction that defines this name?
with Adversarial Job Selection
After the definition 2.1 pls add a note that acts as a potential placeholder for more theory that we might want to add later. 

IN B.2.3 we define the follower problem. pls add a sentence that defines L_k as the load on machine k after scheduling.

In C.2.2 we can add an example of a search tree for better understanding. i have already added a comment there to indicate where exactly it should go.

After that we can start finihing the upper bound computation by inserting a proof there. I already have the proof on paper, we can do that next when you are done with these changes. Thanks a lot!
