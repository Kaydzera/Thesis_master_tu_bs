INSTANCE GENERATION PATTERNS FOR TEST_BIG.PY
==================================================

The 100 test instances were generated using 5 distinct patterns, 
with 20 instances per pattern (determined by instance_id % 5).

Pattern 1: Uniform Ratios (Instances 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 41, 46, 51, 56, 61, 66, 71, 76, 81, 86, 91, 96)
    Items with consistent duration-to-price ratios (1.5-3.0).
    Durations: 3-15, prices calculated from ratio.
    Creates balanced, predictable instances with similar cost-efficiency across jobs.
    
    Characteristics:
    - Low variance in job characteristics
    - Predictable cost-benefit tradeoffs
    - Tests algorithm on well-structured instances

Pattern 2: High Variance (Instances 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, 52, 57, 62, 67, 72, 77, 82, 87, 92, 97)
    Alternates between cheap-long jobs (duration 10-20, price 1-3) 
    and expensive-short jobs (duration 2-5, price 8-15).
    Diverse job portfolios with extreme cost/time tradeoffs.
    
    Characteristics:
    - High variance in duration-to-price ratios
    - Tests algorithm's ability to handle mixed job types
    - Some jobs highly attractive, others poor choices

Pattern 3: Increasing Complexity (Instances 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48, 53, 58, 63, 68, 73, 78, 83, 88, 93, 98)
    Systematic progression where duration = 3+j*2, price = 2+j.
    Jobs become progressively longer and more expensive.
    Structured, predictable difficulty gradient.
    
    Characteristics:
    - Deterministic structure
    - Later jobs consistently worse than earlier jobs
    - Tests algorithm on instances with clear optimal strategies

Pattern 4: Random Uniform (Instances 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49, 54, 59, 64, 69, 74, 79, 84, 89, 94, 99)
    Completely random within realistic bounds (duration 4-18, price 2-12).
    No special structure, tests general algorithm behavior.
    
    Characteristics:
    - Unstructured, realistic instances
    - No exploitable patterns
    - Represents typical real-world scenarios

Pattern 5: Extreme Cases (Instances 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100)
    30% probability: very long & very cheap (duration 20-30, price 1-3)
    70% probability: normal range (duration 3-12, price 3-10)
    Tests edge cases and unusual configurations.
    
    Characteristics:
    - Occasional extremely attractive jobs (long & cheap)
    - Tests algorithm on outliers and edge cases
    - Challenges bound computations with extreme durations

==================================================

GENERATION METHODOLOGY:

All 100 instances vary across three dimensions:
- Number of job types: 6, 7, 8, 10, or 12
- Number of machines: 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8
- Budget: 1.5× to 4× the minimum cost scaled by number of jobs, plus random offset

Random seed: 42 (for reproducibility)

Instance naming convention: Complex_XXX_JY_MZ_B##
- XXX: Instance ID (001-100)
- Y: Number of job types
- Z: Number of machines
- ##: Budget value
